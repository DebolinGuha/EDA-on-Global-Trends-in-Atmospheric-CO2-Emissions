# 🌍 Global Trends in Atmospheric CO2 Emissions

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of atmospheric CO2 emission trends over time using official datasets from the **US Government's Earth System Research Laboratory**. It investigates the **rising trend of CO2 levels**, **increasing annual uncertainty**, and highlights the urgency of climate change mitigation.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division (USA)  
- **Data Series**:
  - 📍 *Mauna Loa Series* (longest continuous data since 1958)
  - 🌐 *Global Average Series* (marine surface site average)
- **Unit**: CO₂ measured in parts per million (ppm)  
- **Key Variables**:
  - `Date`, `Decimal Date`, `Average`, `Interpolated`
  - `Trend` (seasonality removed), `Number of Days`, `Year`, `Uncertainty`, `Annual Increase`

## 🧪 Key Insights

- **📈 Gradual Rise in CO₂ Levels**: Mean monthly and yearly CO2 emissions show a consistent upward trend.
- **📉 Growing Uncertainty**: The annual increase in emissions shows increasing variability over time.
- **📊 Seasonality vs Trend**: The dataset reveals seasonal fluctuations alongside a clear rising long-term trend.
- **📌 Urgency for Deeper Analysis**: Suggests need to explore root causes like deforestation, industrialization, and land-use changes.
